# Trustworthy ML Project
 Trustworthy ML class project

To run the experiments:

   Use "pip install lime" to install LIME. All other libararies used can also be installed using pip.

   run main.py to display results
   
   Some implementation results can be found in the Results folder. Other implementation codes for several other ideas I tried, which are mostly uncompleted can be found in the "Other work done for the project" folder.
